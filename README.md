## ❓ About

Source2Roblox is a super cool C# console application originally created by MaximumADHD that can:
- Rip data from Valve's game files (*.VPK, *.VMT, *.VTF, *.BSP)
- Compile that data into files that Roblox can utilize (*.RBXM, *.RBXL, *.MESH, *.PNG)

This program is not very user-friendly, but if you want to take up the challenge, you can attempt to get S2R up and running!
